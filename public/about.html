<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Nimitha Alumparambil, and it’s a pleasure to meet you. </p>

<p>I’m based in Melbourne and currently work as a Test Engineer at Wipro. With over 2 years of experience, my primary focus has been ensuring the quality and reliability of software products. Over this period, I’ve honed my expertise in both Web and API Automation Testing, deepening my skills in Java programming and object-oriented principles.</p>

<p>My passion for programming and development began in my school years. In my 12th grade, I chose Computer Science as one of my subjects and delved into C++ programming. I was naturally drawn to subjects like Math, Physics, and Computer Science because they all fostered my love for problem-solving. There’s something truly exciting about unraveling complex problems, debugging, and finding solutions, and this enthusiasm ultimately led me to pursue a degree in Engineering.</p>

<p>I hold a bachelor's degree in Electronics and Commnunication Engineering. </p>
